## Course Description

Recent advances in the availability of digital trace data as well as tools for analyzing such data opens up new venues for social science research. These trends allow new types of analysis and open up new arenas for theorization. This course intends to initiate the participants with the tools and insights necessary to navigate and analyze the emerging data landscape. In particular, it aims to provide research students from diverse backgrounds the basic skills and methodological insights to take advantage of digital trace data and computational tools. This course is agnostic to research paradigms and leaves the doors open to participants from qualitative and quantitative backgrounds.
The course is aimed towards research students and possibly junior scholars within fields related to business administration and organization studies, who are interested in engaging hands-on with digital trace data or are interested to learn about the way in which digital tools are transforming social science research.

## Learning Outcomes

During the course the students will:

- Immerse into a new way of qualitative theorizing from digital traces of social interactions, structures and processes beyond hypothesis testing
- Obtain an overview of available digital trace data sources and the tools use to harvest them
- Learn about various methodologies for analyzing the digital trace data, the type of research question that can leverage those methods, and the research design and strategy that can match the research questions with the corresponding data
- Initiate and develop their own data-driven research project under the supervision of the instructors
- Understand the data sources and methods for making sense of an increasingly digitized world
- Gain operational knowledge of a few important analytics and digital research methods
- Focus on use of computational analytic methods for qualitative and explorative research
- Understand how digital methods affect research design and theory building in organization studies

## Target Audience

PhD and research master students from the VU, The Netherlands and abroad, engaged in research projects broadly related to business administration or organization studies. We expect a maximum of 25 participants.

## Deliverables

The students are supposed to read the mandatory course readings and prepare for the class discussion.

For the theory sessions (June 9th, 16th and 23rd) the students will be designated as paper discussants on a voluntary basis. The paper discussant have five to ten minutes to present the gist of the paper, before launching the class discussion. About 30 minutes is allocated to each paper overall.

A hands-on tutorial will follow each theory session. The students must come prepared to the tutorials as well. They have to familiarize themselves with the software package used in the session beforehand. The tutorial exercises will be communicated to the students at least a week in advance.

The students will have to pick one of the presented methods to implement in their term paper. A short paper proposal (2-3 pages) and a usable dataset are due on the day of the workshop session (June 30th).

The final papers are due on the 7th of July. A presentation session is scheduled on the same day so that the students receive constructive feedback from their colleagues and the instructors.

## Grading

- 30% Paper presentation, facilitation of class discussion and active participation in the class 
- 70% Final paper and final paper presentation

## Pre-requisites

The assumption is that the students are initiated to statistics for research, but this is not an absolute prerequisite. It is crucial that students are familiar with computer basics (e.g. know how to navigate their way around the internet) and are proficient in use of computers for handling data files (e.g. using Excel, SPSS, SQL or other software). No experience with coding is necessary, and the course will not require any coding, although knowing how to code can give the students an operational advantage for running more sophisticated projects. The students who lack a basic understanding of the common descriptive and inferential statistics methods may want to take a preliminary statistics course. The students that would like to improve on their data-related informatics skill can get in touch with the instructors beforehand to get tailored recommendations.

## Credits

The seminar will count as 6 ECTS under European credit transfer and accumulation system.
